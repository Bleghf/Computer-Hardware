            <div class="details">
                <p>The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside. Considered the brain of the computer, it interprets and executes instructions from programs, performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.</p>
                <p>Modern CPUs have multiple cores, which allow them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, significantly boosting overall performance.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <p>RAM is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. It is the main memory used by the computer to store data that is actively being used or processed by the CPU.</p>
                <p>RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its data when the computer is turned off. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can handle at any given time, which improves overall system performance.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <p>The hard drive, or hard disk drive (HDD), is the primary storage device used to store all the computerâ€™s data, including the operating system, software applications, and files. It uses spinning disks, or platters, to read and write data.</p>
                <p>Newer systems often use solid-state drives (SSDs), which have no moving parts and offer faster data access speeds and increased reliability compared to traditional hard drives.</p>
